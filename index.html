    <h2><ins>Step 1 : Prepare Oven and Dough:</h2></ins>
    <P><b>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Next prepare the dough for the pizza.</P></b>

         <h2><ins>Step 2: The Cheesier the better:</ins></h2>
        <P><b>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the two pizzas, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges. Evenly distribute the spinach on top of the sauce, followed by the cheese (use all three cups if you want a cheesy pizza as shown here).

        </b></P>
       
        <h2><ins>Step 3: Pizza Toppings:</ins></h2>
        <P><b>Top the pizzas with artichoke, bell pepper, red onion, tomatoes, olives and almonds (if using). Feel Free to add any other toppings to match your taste.
   
   
           </b></P>
          
           <h2><ins>Step 4: Its Baking Time!:</ins></h2> 
           <P><b>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).
           </b></P>

           <h2><ins>Step 5: Time to eat and Save!!!:</ins></h2> 
           <p><b>
            Transfer pizzas to a cutting board and sprinkle with with fresh basil, red pepper flakes and Parmesan, if using. Slice and serve! Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer. Dig in and Enjoy with friends and family(or just yourslef)
